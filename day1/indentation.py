# This code demonstrates the use of indentation in Python.
# Indentation is crucial in Python as it defines the blocks of code.
# Here we have an output loop that prints "Hello" and the value of i 2 times.
for i in range(2):
    print ("Hello")
    print(i)

# Here we have another loop that prints "Hi" 2 times and only once the last value of i (the last iteration).
for i in range(2):
    print ("Hi")
print(i)
